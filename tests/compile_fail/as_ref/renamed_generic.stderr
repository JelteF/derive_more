   = note: trait bound `Foo<i32>: AsRef<Foo<i32>>` was not satisfied
note: the trait `AsRef` must be implemented
  --> $RUST/core/src/convert/mod.rs
   = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is implemented and in scope
   = note: the following trait defines an item `as_ref`, perhaps you need to implement it:
           candidate #1: `AsRef`
